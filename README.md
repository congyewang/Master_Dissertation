## 2.1 Data Folders

This is the folder where the data used by `main.py` and the results generated are stored. The data is divided into three sub-folders according to file types.

### 2.1.1 Midi

This is the folder where the `*.mid` files are downloaded by `main.py` and saved here.

### 2.1.2 CSV

This is the folder with two sub-folders containing the data generated by `main.py` in csv file format.

#### 2.1.2.1 Note

This folder contains the data after the mid file extracts notes, durations and channels.

#### 2.1.2.2 Group

This folder includes the group transformation data assuming that individual notes are stressed as the form of their major triads.

### 2.1.3 DataBases

This folder contains two sqlite3 databases, namely `note.db` and `group.db`.

```python
import sqlalchemy as sqla
import pandas as pd

note_db = sqla.create_engine("sqlite:///Data/DataBases/note.db")

df_BMV772 = pd.read_sql("select * from main.BMV772", note_db)
```

## 2.2 Tests Folder

This is the folder for conducting unit tests.

```shell
pip install pytest

cd ./tests

pytest -m "note"
pytest -m "group"
pytest -v
```

## 2.3 Toolbox Folder

This is the package folder containing the Toolbox class and its set of methods.
